release 0.17
 - human split with no target align (secondary stage) template introduced
 - initial work for stage one (bcl, adapter, phiX and spatial filter to split processing) using templates

 - remove potential deadlock by using non-blocking open of STDIN

release 0.16.4
 - add extra branch to teepot command in to stream seqchksum output downstream (instead of using a file as an internal node)

release 0.16.3
 - add tee after seqchksum (bam) output to split output to file and cmp node, to remove deadlock
 - remove -s flag from all cmp commands (improve diagnostics)
 - decrease teepot timeout for bmd_multiway node back to 300

release 0.16.2

release 0.15
 - fix construction of alternate hash command to construct sha512primesums512 seqchksum file

release 0.14
 - correct prefix value given to calibration_pu -p flag (used in output file naming - it contained an unwanted ".bam")

release 0.13
 - create cram index files

release 0.12
  -viv.pl
    read/write to/from stdin/stdout
    exec failure of a node's command is now fatal (bug fix)
  
  -vtfp.pl
    updated to use new subst_params format in templates
    multiple -keys/-values pairs on the command-line now produce an array on substitution into the template
    when substition of nested parameters is done, array elements which are themselves arrays are flattened
      (its elements are spliced into the position of the original array); net result is that top-level
      parameter substitutions result in either strings or arrays of strings
  
  -templates
    new subst_params format for production templates
    changes to final_output_prep template to add flexibility to this phase of analysis (e.g. y chrom. split)
    output of seqchksum files for hash type sha512primesums512 added

release 0.09
  -install action should not remove lib directory at target
