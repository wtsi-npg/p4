CHANGES LOG
-----------

 - port naming conventions (IN/OUT pre- and postfixes) adopted in templates and enforced in viv.pl
 - vtfp.pl
    improved error reporting
    refactoring to ensure more consistent/intuitive evaluation of parameter values
    allow specification of "local" parameter substitution (within a specific vtnode)
    added --param_vals --export_param_vals flags
    subst directive attributes ifnull and required added
    remove dead code, review relevance of comments, general tidying
    more tests
 - add tests for viv.pl

release 0.17
 - human split with no target align (secondary stage) template introduced
 - initial work for stage one (bcl, adapter, phiX and spatial filter to split processing) using templates
 - bammarkduplicates reintroduced for unaligned file because downstream qc processing relies on presence of markdups_metrics file
 - library cram merging: merge_aligned.json and merge_final_output_prep.json
 - remove potential deadlock by using non-blocking open of STDIN

release 0.16.4
 - add extra branch to teepot command in to stream seqchksum output downstream (instead of using a file as an internal node)

release 0.16.3
 - add tee after seqchksum (bam) output to split output to file and cmp node, to remove deadlock
 - remove -s flag from all cmp commands (improve diagnostics)
 - decrease teepot timeout for bmd_multiway node back to 300

release 0.16.2
 - remove superfluous "-" argumant to bamseqchksum command
 - increase teepot timeout for bmd_multiway node to 50000 (from 500)

release 0.16.1
 - add tempdir parameter and verbose (-v) flag for teepot

release 0.16
 - human split: new alignment_wtsi_stage2_humansplit_template.json, seqchksum_hs.json; addition of subst_params to alignment_common
 - seqchksum comparisons: merge bamseqchksum files for outputs for comparison with initial bam file in seqchksum.json
 - added comparison of cram and bam seqchksum within final_output_prep
 - scramble reference optional in final_output_prep template (reference name passed as a parameter instead of via subgraph_io)
 - realignment templates fixes/amendents: default value for common subst_params file; default to cram input

release 0.15
 - fix construction of alternate hash command to construct sha512primesums512 seqchksum file

release 0.14
 - correct prefix value given to calibration_pu -p flag (used in output file naming - it contained an unwanted ".bam")

release 0.13
 - create cram index files

release 0.12
  -viv.pl
    read/write to/from stdin/stdout
    exec failure of a node's command is now fatal (bug fix)
  
  -vtfp.pl
    updated to use new subst_params format in templates
    multiple -keys/-values pairs on the command-line now produce an array on substitution into the template
    when substition of nested parameters is done, array elements which are themselves arrays are flattened
      (its elements are spliced into the position of the original array); net result is that top-level
      parameter substitutions result in either strings or arrays of strings
  
  -templates
    new subst_params format for production templates
    changes to final_output_prep template to add flexibility to this phase of analysis (e.g. y chrom. split)
    output of seqchksum files for hash type sha512primesums512 added

release 0.09
  -install action should not remove lib directory at target
